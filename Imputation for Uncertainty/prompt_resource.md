The points belong to two groups Cyan and Orange. However, the original dataset has certain missing values in either the X or Y for every variable.</span>
<span style="background-color: #cedfff">[A]We use a statistical method called imputation to estimate these points. The point represents the most likely (average) estimate of the missing data point derived from the imputation method.</span>

<span style="background-color: #7dacff">[A]There are five different uncertainty representations, each for a graph provided. In the first graph (none), data points with missing values are not shown as they cannot be accurately plotted on the chart. In the second graph (mean), the missing points are estimated, and the mean of these estiamtes are represented as hollow points. In the third graph (ci), we represent this uncertainty using the bars which represent the 95% confidence interval.This interval tells you the uncertainty associated with the imputed value. In the fourth graph (density), we represent this uncertainty using the probability density plots. In the fifth graph (gradient), we represent this uncertainty using the gradient plots showing 95% confidence intervals.This interval tells you the uncertainty associated with the imputed value.</span> </div>

<span style="background-color: #d7eefc">The graph on the left shows the relationship between two variables X and Y. The points belong to two groups Cyan and Orange. However, the original dataset has certain missing values in either the X or Y for every variable. The total amount of missing data in this graph is 46%; 12% of the observations in Group Cyan are missing, and 34% of the observations in Group Orange are missing.</span>

<span style="background-color: #cedfff">We use a statistical method called imputation to estimate these points. The point represents the most likely (average) estimate of the missing data point derived from the imputation method. However, as imputation cannot precisely estimate values for the missing data points, we also get some uncertainty from our imputation method. In this graph, the missing points are estimated, and the mean of these estiamtes are represented as hollow points.</span>

<span style="background-color: #aac9ff">However, imputation methods cannot precisely calculate the value of a missing observation, instead providing an estimate with some degree of uncertainty.</span>

<span style="background-color: #7dacff">Baseline: No Imputation All complete cases are represented using a scatterplot with any missing observations not presented to the viewer. Mean: Mean Point Estimate Mean point estimates derived from our imputation method are represented using unfilled circle marks, while observed values are represented using filled circles similar to the baseline. CI: Mean Point Estimate with 95% Confidence Intervals 95% confidence intervals are one of the most commonly used encodings for communicating uncertainty. Since we have distributional information about each imputation, we estimate the 95% upper and lower bounds of this distribution and represent each imputed value using a point estimate and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Density: Probability Density Plots. Gradient: Gradient Plots Showing 95% Confidence Intervals.</span>
