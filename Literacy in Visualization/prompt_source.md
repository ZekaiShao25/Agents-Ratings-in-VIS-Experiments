# CALVI

+ For each prompt, where each sentence is preceded by a symbol identifying it, `[A]` indicates that the sentence was migrated directly from the paper material, `[B]` indicates that the sentence was modified slightly based on the paper material, and `[C]` indicates that the sentence was added by ourselves based on specific needs.
+ Sentences identified by `[A]` and `[B]` have a background color, which is used to distinguish between different sources of the paper material. Sentences identified by the `[C]` do not have a background color.

## TASK

### prompt

<div style="background-color: #e1e1e1; color: #333333; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><span style="background-color: #cbf1ca">[A]Please rate the item on a scale of 1 (not relevant) to 4 (highly relevant) based on the image and give your reason. </span><span style="background-color: #a8f0a7">[A]The relevance meaning that differences in ability (i.e., the ability to read, interpret, and reason about erroneous or potentially misleading visualizations) should lead to differences in measurement outcomes (i.e., correctness). High relevance indicates that this visualization and task contain high-related misleading elements.</span></div>

### resource

<span style="background-color: #cbf1ca">We invited five domain experts to rate the 49 items in our bank on a scale of 1 (not relevant) to 4 (highly relevant).</span>

<span style="background-color: #a8f0a7">Validity of a test is essentially making sure that there is a causal relationship between the ability being measured and peopleâ€™s performance on the test, meaning that differences in ability (i.e., the ability to read, interpret, and reason about erroneous or potentially misleading visualizations) should lead to differences in measurement outcomes (i.e., correctness).</span>
