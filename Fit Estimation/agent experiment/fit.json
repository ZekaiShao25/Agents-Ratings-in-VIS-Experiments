However, I can provide you with a general approach to estimating the fit of data points to a model line in scatterplots.\n\nTo estimate how well the data points fit the model line, you would typically look at how close the data points are to the line. The closer the points are to the line, the better the fit. If the points are widely scattered around the line, the fit is poor. If the points are tightly clustered around the line, the fit is good.\n\nHere's a hypothetical scoring based on the description:\n\n1. For the first scatterplot, if the points are closely clustered around the line y = 2.5 + 0.5*x, the score might be high, say around 80-90.\n2. For the second scatterplot, if the points are a bit more spread out but still show a clear trend with the line, the score might be moderate to high, say around 70-80.\n3. For the third scatterplot, if the points are even more spread out but still follow the trend of the line, the score might be moderate, say around 60-70.\n\nPlease note that these scores are purely illustrative and would depend on the actual distribution of points in the scatterplots.\n\nHere is the JSON format of the hypothetical scores:\n\n```json\n[80, 70, 60]\n```",
