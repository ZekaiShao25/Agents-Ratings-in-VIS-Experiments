# fit

+ For each prompt, where each sentence is preceded by a symbol identifying it, `[A]` indicates that the sentence was migrated directly from the paper material, `[B]` indicates that the sentence was modified slightly based on the paper material, and `[C]` indicates that the sentence was added by ourselves based on specific needs.
+ Sentences identified by `[A]` and `[B]` have a background color, which is used to distinguish between different sources of the paper material. Sentences identified by the `[C]` do not have a background color.

## Role Play

#### prompt

<div style="background-color: #e1e1e1; color: #333333; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><span style="background-color: #FFF2CC">[B]You are an average user.</span></div>

#### resource

<span style="background-color: #FFF2CC">Participants were 62 German speaking psychology students (41 females, age M ¼ 32.7 years, SD ¼ 9.2) who participated in experiments for course credit. We did not find an indication of suspicious rating behavior (e.g., random patterns).</span>

## TASK(rating)

#### prompt

<div style="background-color: #e1e1e1; color: #333333; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"><span style="background-color: #cbf1ca">[A]Here are {number} scatterplots. You are instructed to estimate how well the data points fitted to the shown line. Your score ranges from 0 (very low fit) to 100 (very high fit), a perfect fit would be to have all data points on the line. Please list the scores and the reason in the order of the images.</span></div>

#### resource

<span style="background-color: #cbf1ca">Each participant was presented with 30 scatterplots in a randomized order and was instructed to estimate how well the data points fitted to the shown line. Participants had to rate the fit by using a slider bar that was shown below the graph. They were instructed to use the computer mouse to place the slider on a position between 0 (very low fit) and 100 (very high fit). Before starting, we pointed out that a perfect fit would be to have all data points on the line.</span>
