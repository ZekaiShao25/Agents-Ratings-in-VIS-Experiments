# Prompt Summary

+ The columns of this table represent the different experiments (seven in total), and the rows represent the kinds of prompts that the experiments may require.
+ For the prompt in each cell, where each sentence is preceded by a symbol identifying it, `[A]` indicates that the sentence was migrated directly from the paper material, `[B]` indicates that the sentence was modified slightly based on the paper material, and `[C]` indicates that the sentence was added by ourselves based on specific needs.
+ Sentences identified by `[A]` and `[B]` have a background color, which is used to distinguish between different sources of the paper material. The specific content of the paper material and its correspondence with the prompt are shown in the `prompt_resource.md` file in the directory corresponding to each experiment. Sentences identified by the `[C]` do not have a background color.

By looking at the visualization, you know that here are 112 days: Each day follows the structure 'Day X-Week Y-Month Z', where 'X' denotes the day of the week (ranging from Day 1 to Day 7) , 'Y' indicates the week of the month (ranging from Week 1 to Week 4), and 'Z' specifies the month of the year (January, February, March, April). </span><span style="background-color: #d7eefc">[B]For line chart, the y-value of point indicates the the daily sale. For heatmap, the color shade of the cell indicates the daily sale. For icicle plot, the size of the rectangle indicates the sale.</span></td>
        <td><span style="background-color: #cbf1ca">[A]By looking at these three visualizations (line chart, heatmap, icicle), your goal is to identify the day(Day X-Week Y-Month Z) with the absolute highest sales through individual visualisations.</span> [C]Just determine which day has the maximum sale.</td>

        <td><span style="background-color: #d7eefc">[A]The graphs show the relationship between two variables X and Y. The points belong to two groups Cyan and Orange. However, the original dataset has certain missing values in either the X or Y for every variable.</span><span style="background-color: #cedfff">[A]We use a statistical method called imputation to estimate these points. The point represents the most likely (average) estimate of the missing data point derived from the imputation method.</span> <span style="background-color: #aac9ff">[A]However, as imputation cannot precisely estimate values for the missing data points, we also get some uncertainty from our imputation method. </span><span style="background-color: #7dacff">[A]There are five different uncertainty representations, each for a graph provided. In the first graph (none), data points with missing values are not shown as they cannot be accurately plotted on the chart. In the second graph (mean), the missing points are estimated, and the mean of these estiamtes are represented as hollow points. In the third graph (ci), we represent this uncertainty using the bars which represent the 95% confidence interval.This interval tells you the uncertainty associated with the imputed value. In the fourth graph (density), we represent this uncertainty using the probability density plots. In the fifth graph (gradient), we represent this uncertainty using the gradient plots showing 95% confidence intervals.This interval tells you the uncertainty associated with the imputed value.</span></td>

So you need to choose the way of dealing with the task based on a human perspective, and NOTE that humans are subject to cognitive and perceptual factors.</span> <span style="background-color: #58f066">[A]For each uncertainty representation, complete the following task: Based on the understanding of how missing data is imputed, estimate the average value of X of the whole dataset(including both cyan and orange group, and both real and imputed data).</span> [C]You need to tell me the exact process of completing the task using the visualizations and the difficulties you may encounter, and DO NOT give your final answer of the task.</td>
        <td><span style="background-color: #F0DFC4">[A]From the human perspective you are simulating, for each of the representations, rate your confidence in your answer on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 representing the highest confidence.</span> [C]As an average human participant, DO NOT state individual variance on this task, and you MUST give an specific answer.</td>
